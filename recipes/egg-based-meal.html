    <h3>Simple and Super Tasty!</h3>
    <p>Do you like bread? Sure you do. How about bread when it's toasted? Even better, right? Now, do you like eggs? Especially when they're cooked? Are you tired of these questions? Then you'll love this recipe! It's so easy even Richard J. Dowling can do it.</p>
    <H4>Ingredients (for one Billy No-mates)</H4>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking oil or butter</li>
        <li>2 slices of bread</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>cheese</li>
    <h4>Steps to follow</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>crack open the eggs into a bowl and beat until you get bored</li>
        <li>prepare the sliced bread so it's ready to hand</li>
        <li>heat pan and add oil or butter</li>
        <li>pour in the eggs</li>
        <li>while egg is still liquid, plonk the bread down and then turn the slices over so they're coated in egg on both sides</li>
        <li>after a little while turn the whole thing over and then place cheese and whatever other fillings occur to you on the bread.</li>
        <li>now, flip one slice on top of the other so you have a sandwich and continue cooking, flipping the whole thing over occasionally until it's all golden.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
        <li>do the washing up</li>
        <li>proceed with whatever other plans you have for the evening, though we both know it's going to be Netflix on your own until you fall into the sweet arms of oblivion</li>
    </ol>   
        
    </ul>
